# Calculating the composite availability SLA for your stack 

The following guide below will help you calculate your own availability.

Two parts to the guide according to what you are after.
- The actuarial science behind the calculation(which is just probability of "something" being available or unavailable)
- SLA Calculation guide to maximum downtime possible.


## The Actuarial science

The calculation of service levels is purely to assess the risk or the probability of failure and taken as a mathematical problem.

> Suggestion: Skip this if purely interested in just availability percentages. Go [here](#calculating-your-downtime-or-availability-percentages)

Let us consider the sample space of the following detail.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320602/177605531-3d0c096e-48ef-4b7e-b54e-48830a424a87.png)

**SLA sumary for Azure services taken independently**

- Azure DNS: 100% availability (so will remove from consideration in this problem, as will not skew the calculation)
- Azure Front door : 99.99% availability or 0.0001 probability of going down
- Azure App service: 99.95% availability or 0.0005 probability of going down


> Note: Although App service is declared with an SLA of 99.95%, with the GA of zonal redundancy that should increase to 99.99% - but that has not been documented yet. For the case of this will be using as described [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/support/legal/sla/summary/)

**Sample spaces for the probability:**

*Mutually exclusive events*
- App service Region 1(AR1) is down but Azure Front door (FD is up)
- App service Region 2(AR2) is down but FD is up

*Independent events*
- AR1 and AR2 is down
- Azure Front door(FD) is down
- FD is down or AR1 and AR2 is down


>For the Mutually exclusive events that either AR1 or AR2 is down, but not both simultaneously

$$P(AR1 \space and \space AR2) = P \left( AR1 \space ∩ \space AR2 ) = 0 \right)$$

There by the probability of unavailability is 0 for the mutually exclusive events both occuring

> For the Mutually exclusive events , then probability of either occuring

<p>
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P(AR1 \space OR \space AR2) & = P(AR1 ∪ AR2) \\
              & = (P(AR1) + P(AR2) - P(AR1 ∩ AR2) \\
              & = P(AR1) + P(AR2) - 0 \\
              & = P(AR1) + P(AR2)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
</p>

calculating that as values
- Probability of AR1 to be down : 0.0005
- Probability of AR1 to be down : 0.0005

*Probability of either to be down:*
$$P(AR1 \space and \space AR2) \space = 0.0005 + 0.0005 = 0.001 $$


#### Calculating the probability of only operating on a single region

Two independent events
- Azure Front door being available = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999
- Either of AR1 or AR2 being available(AR1|AR2): 1 - 0.001 = 0.999

Overall probability of only being operational on a single region

$$P(FD \space and \space AR1|AR2) \space = \space P(FD \space ∪ \space AR1|AR2 )\space = P(FD)P(AR1|AR2) = 0.999 \space * \space 0.9999 = 0.9989001 $$

> In percentage = 99.89001%.


### Overall availability/unavailability

*Overall unavailability* is the scenario `FD is down or (AR1 and AR2) is down`

- AR1 and AR2 are down as independent events AR1||AR2

  $$P(AR1 ∪ AR2) = P(AR1) \space * \space P(AR2) = 0.0005 * 0.0005 = 0.00000025 $$

- FD is down as a independent event from AR1 and AR2 being down as independent events AR1||AR2

    $$P(FD ∩ AR1||AR2) = P(FD) \space * \space P(AR1||AR2) = 0.0001 * 0.00000025 = 0.00000000025 $$


- FD is down as a mutually exclusive event from AR1 and AR2 being down as independent events, but either can occur

    $$P(FD U AR1||AR2) = P(FD) \space +  \space P(AR1||AR2) \space - \space P(FD ∩ AR1||AR2)) = 0.0001 + 0.00000025 - 0.00000000025 = 0.00010025 $$

Overall probability of availability = 1 - 0.00010025 = 0.99989975

> In percentage: availability = 99.989975%

## Calculating your downtime or availability percentages

The simplified calculation below just uses probability rules described above to calculate the compound availability of the stack.


>Note: A few examples are given below to demon

### Stack for a stateless web application

SLA calculation guide for the following detail:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320602/177605320-3c4876dc-3e76-4645-8d58-24476048fc6d.png)


**SLA summary for Azure services taken independently**

- Akamai : 99.999%
- Azure DNS: 100% availability (so will remove from consideration in this problem, as will not skew the calculation)
- Azure Front door : 99.99% availability or 0.0001 probability of going down
- Azure App service: 99.95% availability or 0.0005 probability of going down

> Azure App service across both regions being down as independent events simultaneously

$$ 0.05 \% * 0.05 \%   = 0.000025\% $$

So availability: 99.999975%

> Either of Akamai OR Azure Frontdoor Or Azure App service across both regions being down

$$ 99.999\% * 99.99\% * 99.999975\% = 99.9889\% $$

> The overall SLA of the stack is `99.9889%`


### Stack for a stateless web application through a private link with regional Redis cache

SLA calculation guide for the following detail:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320602/177605402-8bb83bc0-c15a-48b4-8a0c-9544076b9a26.png)

**SLA summary for Azure services taken independently**

- Akamai : 99.999%.(This could well be 100% - something to validate contractually)
- Azure DNS: 100% availability (so will remove from consideration in this problem, as will not skew the calculation)
- Azure Front door : 99.99% availability or 0.0001 probability of going down
- Azure App service: 99.95% availability or 0.0005 probability of going down
- Azure private link: 99.99% availability or 0.0001 probability of going down
- Azure Redis (individual region - for any Standard): 99.9% or 0.001 probability of going down

>Although considering Redis being used as a cache (read/write through) and should not "really" affect the SLA, we would consider it technically as part of this calculation demonstration.

> Composite Availability of App Service and Redis within a region (inclusive of private link)

$$ 99.95 \% * 99.99\% * 99.9 \%   = 99.84\% $$

unavailability of a region : 0.16% (100 - 99.84)

> Unavailability of two regions of App Service, private link and Redis.

$$ 0.16 \% * 0.16 \%   = 0.000256\% $$

> Compound Availability of App service and Redis over two regions: 99.999744%

> Compound availability of the stack (Akamai * Frontdoor * ( (appservice + redis)both regions) ))

$$ 99.999 \% * 99.99\% * 99.999744 \%   = 99.9887\% $$


> The overall SLA of the stack is `99.9887%`


Follow the approach as in the above examples to calculate the composite availability of the stack you deploy appropriate to the configuration (eg: types of instances will have different SLAs premium vs standard)


## Downtime calculation.

- For a 24 hour period, the maximum allowed downtime(error budget) for an availability of `99.9887%` is 9.76 seconds $((100-99.9887)/100 * 24 * 3600))$
- For a month, the maximum allowed downtime is `~ 5 minutes`
